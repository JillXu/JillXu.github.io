    <h2>About me</h2>
	I was born and grew up in Baoying, a small town in CHINA, with my beloved parents. After my graduation from secondary school, I made one of my biggest decision in my life: to go to high school in other cities, which is Yang Zhou. During my high school, I spent a happy time with my friends, who are still supporting me in many areas. In Year 3, I made another decision to go to study electronics in Nanjing University instead of Fudan University because Fudan offered me the bachelor of prophylactic medicine, which I did not like it. In the beginning of my university, I faced a lot of difficulty about my study and my GPA is low. However, in order to get the opportunity to study in America, I tried my best to catch up and I succeeded. Moreover, I gained an important award, the First Prize in National University Electronic Design Competition. When I was junior, I went to the Chinese University of Hong Kong as an exchange student, which must be the most fantastic time in my life. During those days, I ate a lot, played a lot and studied a lot. From the depth of my heart, I love Hong Kong.
	<br>I love eating and finding delicious food. Exactly, I love exploring because I want to try different things. I could buy over 20 kinds of notebooks to find the best one.
